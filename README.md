# T-Chat

T-Chat is a web-based chat room for friends to talk tech. The app was built with purely front-end technology. Firebase provided the back-end with a no-sql database. Using AngularJS the app works in real time communicating with Firebase to listening devices.

## Problem

When creating this application the chief issue was to build this project using only JavaScript. Frameworks can be used but no back-end languages could be used in the application itself.

## Solution

The solution to this issue was Firebase. Firebase serves as a back-end system with a no-sql database. This allows a developer to quickly set-up web or mobile applications without worrying about large infrastructure. Using AngularJS my application communicates with Firebase in real-time to allow users to chat with each other.
